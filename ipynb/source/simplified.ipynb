    "## ALL OF THE CONCEPTS STARTED FROM INVESTIGATING THE FOLLOWING PHENOMENA (REFER TO SECTION \"Vehicle reference frame positions\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "In repeated observations of vehicles within a defined region, the measured frequency of cars displaying a specific number-plate pattern, with the pre-fix \"DA\" within the NEW SOUTH WALES registration scheme significantly exceeded the predicted probability derived from the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Abstract**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section develops a **Computational Theory of Relativity** to account for a set of persistent, high-magnitude deviations observed in vehicle number-plate frequencies starting with the prefix-DA within the NSW registration scheme and also a defined region. Empirically, outcomes that should be rare under a classical binomial model (e.g., (p=0.01), (n=1000), (E[X]=10), (\\sigma\\approx3.15)) are repeatedly observed at rates on the order of (X>200), and this anomaly persists across many consecutive days—driving the compound improbability to effectively zero under standard assumptions. A further critical feature is **observer discrepancy**: simultaneous observers in the same locality report incompatible distributions (e.g., (0%) vs (30%)), implying the measured statistics are **observer-dependent** rather than globally objective (relative probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain these observations, the framework treats each observer and observed system as a **computational process** embedded in a broader **computational reference field**. The theory is explicitly **stateful**: information must be stored and present observations depend not only on immediate conditions but also on complex information that include rules which are understandable to human comprehension. For example, the pre-fix \"DA\" within a set of known number-plates in a given region is effectively used to perform a computation, information such as the concept of \"NEW SOUTH WALES REGISTRATION SCHEME\" can be used as inputs to effect the configuration of a molecule. The computational field is also aware of the identities who hold those number plates, and can use this information to perform calculations to alter its positions. Most importantly, the deviation cannot be reduced to **internal dynamics** that are local physical interactions (mass, time, forces, energy and conversions, drivers, engines, traffic micro-behaviors). If the mechanism were internal physical interactions, generalized by different local forces that act on each body, similarly configured physical systems under similar external conditions would converge toward similar probability distributions, but the distributions of probability are too greatly deviated in this investigation. The persistence of incompatible local distributions indicate that external information (not intrinsic mechanics alone) is used to conduct operations in the form of computational calculations that have an impact of the configuration and state of a molecule; which accounts for the deviation, and relates information such as the DA-prefix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the document connects the empirical deviation to an **entropic/informational bias** formalized through reweighting (e.g., a cross-entropy divergence between the expected distribution (P) and the observed distribution (Q)), interpreting the anomaly as a computationally induced effect on the system’s state. In this view, the state space—defined over positions and configurations—has been deformed in a curved manner analogous to curvature in gravitational space-time fields. The subsequent propositions formalize these claims and outline simulation-based verification against binomial expectations.\n",

    "\n",
    "  Relative probability is an addition to the theory of relativity which has been discovered from the completion of this work. Distant information tied to human concepts and conventions clearly changed the probability of an event and it must have been done through a computational and informational field or framework. The thought experiments of Einstein and Lorentz may be understood not solely as geometric outcomes dictated by the constancy of the speed of light, but as evidence for the existence of an informational and computational field. For example, whenever there is time dilation present, it indicates that a computational process (as a task) is taking too long to complete. In this way, the unusual phenomena documented in empirical observations are accounted for by the presence of a computational field and re-integrated through the new interpretation of the theory of relativity. Thus, information was applied within the computational field to change a molecule’s state which had an impact on its position and configuration. Performing that computation required energy and subsequently causes time dilation; therefore, information can be treated as a form of energy. This implies the existence of mechanisms for extracting information from molecular configurations that show significant deviations from expected probability distributions. At no point do these findings conflict with established physical sciences; rather, interpreting relativity as a computational field expands the breadth and scope of possible explanations in physics, addressing questions—such as the emergence of life from nothing—that general physics alone cannot adequately resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this work, Lorentz’s experimental results were reinterpreted through a framework aligned with a computational-field philosophy. In this view, there is no truly inertial frame in the conventional sense: only the absolute reference frame qualifies as inertial. With that premise in place, the mathematics is reformulated by introducing an absolute unit of time—bibs. Consequently, if two processes occur simultaneously within the absolute reference frame, they will agree on the same number of bibs that have elapsed relative to the absolute reference frame (as we can see in proposition 1). Accordingly, all reference frames retain a degree of agreement about when an event occurs—analogous to the classical notion of absolute time—except that, here, this shared timing is grounded in an independent underlying framework rather than being built into the classical spacetime model.\n",

    "* ##### **Proposition 1: Absolute time related to proper time dilation formula and the Absolute Reference Frame**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  The absolute reference frame is a cross-relational frame of reference that underlies the physical world. It functions as a computational field through which information propagates, and within which processes require a definite amount of absolute time to complete. On this view, time dilation arises when a computational process takes longer to complete under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Einstein’s and Lorentz’s analyses began from the assumption that the speed of light is constant. That assumption imposes geometric constraints on spacetime, from which the standard time-dilation formulas emerge. In this framework, the time-dilation formulas are not treated as a primary principle in themselves, but as a geometric consequence of the underlying computational field. Accordingly, Einstein and Lorentz could derive time dilation accurately without explicitly being aware of a computational field, because the constant speed of light acts as a synchronization tool: it ticks at the same rate as absolute time (see below). That is, absolute time and light are not subject to dilation, and because of this property, one can derive the time-dilation formulas without adding the new computational framework to the theory of relativity (without the concept of absolute time). Therefore, Lorentz arrived at these equations because of this complexity in the system (this current system is flawless in design).\n",

All reference frames must agree on how much absolute time has elapsed (setting aside the concept of bib-dilation). This follows logically from the computational analogy: in a computer, every process is governed by the same underlying clock rate, all observers must agree that the same time has elapsed relative to that frame of reference, which is seen as evidence of a computational absolute reference frame. That is, an inertial reference frame can be treated as an absolute reference frame, because all observers agree on the amount of time that has elapsed relative to it. The fact that the inertial frame maintains the same time relative to all other observers—serves as evidence for the existence of an absolute reference frame and the requirements for the philosophy which is an alteration to the works that have been derived since.

    "    This portion is especially challenging to develop and is not required for the material to be useful. However, for simplicity, I rely on Boltzmann-derived probabilistic models to estimate the relative energy required to produce shifts in the system. Boltzmann’s conclusions originate in information-like, combinatorial reasoning. That perspective is particularly appropriate here, because computational frameworks are inherently informational systems. Hence, through analysis of the models we can see that they match up according to our expected intuition about the system. In some physical systems, empirical testing is necessary rather than relying solely on geometric reasoning. For example, Lorentz could infer geometric consequences using concepts that were readily analyzable without extensive experimentation. In this case, however, experiments may be the more appropriate approach, given the substantially greater complexity and number of interacting factors that must be accounted for. This can be checked experimentally by identifying variations between the expected clock rates across reference frames in which life forms exist. That is, in certain environments—for example, large cities—there may be greater dilation attributable to computational requirements and their downstream effects, similar to the DA-prefix incidents of number plates. The dilation is most likely governed by a constant and may be related to the probability dilation introduced in Proposition 4: $$\\boxed{p_{life} = 1 - \\frac{k_{b}T}{k_{e}\\gamma^2}}$$ \n",

    "    since the energy or information acted upon cannot exceed the processing capacity of the field itself, the informational capacity of the field must be greater or equal to the informational content of the system. Accordingly, the ratio $\\frac{k_B T}{k_e \\gamma^2}$ is interpreted as a **processing ratio**, which explains why the model provides a stable and accurate approximation. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    The quantity $\\frac{k_B T}{\\gamma^2}$ corresponds to the second derivative of $ \\Delta E = -k_B T \\ln \\gamma $. We use the derivative because, for any $\\gamma^2 > 1$, a portion of total original energy is altered or \"consumed\", and information is porportional to that energy shift, therefore, the larger the shifts, the greater the computation. In this molecular model, the kBT term can be replaced by energy, and the model can only deal with small amounts of energy because of the sheer volume of information in larger systems (however $k_e$ can provide a corrective feature); meaning, there is only a few values of kBT that it should be applicable to (as you can see above with the condition).\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's important to note that the chosen derivative of ($\\gamma$) can reflect processing power (as the power increases the change is quicker), whilst the term $k_{e}$ is the amount of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  The above is an early and accurate estimate. Note that, in the early stages of computation, the processing requirements are relatively larger (small in comparison) and then approach a constant as the system becomes organized. As the formula indicates, for large $\\gamma$ the ratio approaches one, and is more or less constant, which represents the constant requirements from intuitive investigation. In other words, organizing a system initially requires more informational input than maintaining it once it is already organized. Lastly, the amount of information contained at the origin where the informational field acts is very small relative to the rest of the system. Due to holographness, the field influences only a limited subset of the system (and that part it effects has tiny energies), and as a result we expect the effective processing range to be extremely narrow, as discussed in the following paragraph (explained in the following video).\n",

This model places it between about (0.96) and (0.999999999) without the Ke term being set, which is still close in relative terms and suggests the estimate is already within the correct order of magnitude. The rationale is that, because the discrepancy (of the informational computational field) has not been clearly detected by current scientists empirically, any deviation from unity must be small, and for that reason it was overlooked. As we had stated, the true processing level is likely in the range of roughly (0.9999) to (0.9999999) which is why it wasn't detected.\n",

    "  In spite of that, the above remains a very good estimate from a probabilistic perspective, and it is actually very accurate. We have to realize that the cause of changes in probabilities is ultimately forces acting on each body, and the probabilistic system is used to provide an easier passage for dealing with scenarios involving complicated interactions (such as human body movement, which requires psychological motion). In that way, known physical laws become more difficult to interpret in the context of psychological change, because they incorporate psychological frameworks within a body. These frameworks are altered at the level of the system as a whole, rather than through isolated action of a force on each molecule in a body. The resulting effects are then left for the body to manage as an integrated, innervated system.\n",

    "  Computational fields acting on molecular systems are highly irreversible processes. Without the field, the probability distribution over a particle’s positions relaxes toward non-informational states, and the informational energy associated with control and constraint is effectively lost. This helps explain why biological organisms operate through strongly irreversible processes: once the field-like control is removed, there is no practical way to reconstruct the prior, information-bearing configuration or state, adding an additional layer of irreversibility typical of living systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In biology, informational control is offloaded to cellular structures (e.g., organelles and regulatory machinery). As a result, particle positions within the cell encode functional information because they are continuously maintained by physical mechanisms that act as “computational fields.” This is distinct from a computational field in relativity, because biological organisms recreate these fields through the creation of organs or organelles (which can be treated as a computational field in relativity), and these organs provide “information” to molecular positions. When a cell dies, those mechanisms cease, the configurations lose their functional meaning, and the system irreversibly collapses into meaningless states. This means that biological organization requires persistent maintenance, analogous to a computational field affecting a region of particles, without the field, the particles wouldn't be capable of retaining the informational energy component, making these processes highly irreversible.\n",

    "\n",
    "  At the same time, (k_E) serves a functional purpose: it supplies the curvature required to shape the graph in a way that is analogous to relativistic “curvature” effects. Without (k_E), the behavior of the model is essentially classical. It is also worth noting that the mere necessity of inserting a constant to cancel units can implicitly introduce a non-classical effect, even if the author does not recognize that this is what has occurred—in other words, one can arrive at non-classical conclusions simply by following a mechanical set of steps.\n",

    "* **Corollary 2: WHY IS THE TIME DILATION SO ACCURATE USING PROBABILISTIC SYSTEMS?** \n",
    "\n",
    "  Holographness is the notion that a field does not uniformly affect an entire physical system, but instead targets particular components. In this sense, gravitational fields are distinct from motion and influence systems in fundamentally different ways. The key point of the formula is that it was initially puzzling how such a high level of accuracy could be achieved without explicitly including certain information. Probabilistic systems, by their nature, omit details about forces, even though forces are precisely what drive changes in probability (they also don't deal with mass, and more in realtion to energy on top of the system).The field we identified primarily altered the probabilities governing the motion of cars or molecules; accordingly, the information modified by the field corresponded directly to those forces, and not to other parts of the system such as mass, which is unnecessary for altering probabilities. For example, if 500 molecules experience a force pushing them to the left, a substantially larger fraction will accumulate on the left side of a box. Classical probability treatments in statistical mechanics typically abstract away this directional force information. Crucially, the information that is excluded by these probabilistic models is exactly what the informational field acts upon. This is why the resulting estimates remain remarkably accurate despite the apparent absence of force-level detail.   \n",

    "\n",
    "    All physical fields can be understood as computational fields, including classical fields such as the electric field as well as informational fields, as evidenced by the observed number-plate phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Within this framework, computational fields can be classified into two broad categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Universal fields:\n",
    "    These fields are persistent, stable, and reproducible. Their effects are consistent across time and objects, making them invariant features of the physical or informational environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Diminished (or sporadic) fields:\n",
    "    These fields exhibit limited strength, duration, or scope. For example, the duration of a dimished field as seen with the DA-prefix is non-universal in time, that is, it can be turned on and off in duration. An enormous number of diminished fields exist, each operating with a distinct information-processing structure, the difference in the processing will cause a variation in the output (informational) of the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scholium 1:**\n",
    "    Diminished fields are essential for explaining how life can arise spontaneously, as the fields influence is neither universal nor constant across space and time. For example, life isn't spontenously generating in all places at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scholium 2:**\n",
    "    Distinct diminished fields process information independently. Variations in the informational processing of a given diminished field modify the probability structure of the system it acts upon, and biological variation emerges as a consequence of these differences in the character of the field.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Holographness can be a property of both universal fields and diminished fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Holographness refers to the partial nature of a field in which its influence does not extend uniformly across all objects. As an analogy, one may be able to speak to a ghost and be heard, yet the ghost can walk through the person without physical resistance. The interaction is real but incomplete: certain channels of interaction are available (information exchange), while others are absent (mechanical or material coupling). The ghost is present within the same space, but the coupling between entities is selective rather than total. In such cases, the field acts selectively rather than universally.\n",

    "* **Demonstration 1: Diminished fields - DA-prefix Number Plate Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, in the case of diminished fields, an informational field may affect only a specific subset of objects—such as vehicles with DA-prefix number plates. This selectivity introduces partiality in how the field manifests, with only certain objects exhibiting measurable effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Secondary to this, the field’s influence is not localized to a single object but is distributed across the system in a non-uniform, holographic manner.\n",

    "* **Demonstration 2: Invariableness of Light as Holographness**\n",
    "\n",
    "    As a train moves, its material components acquire the train’s velocity, whereas light does not. This demonstrates that the train’s motion influences only certain internal elements, implying a holographic property in which a system’s characteristics apply selectively rather than universally.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scholium 1:**\n",
    "    Holographness is a foundational property that enables the construction of a theory of everything within a computational framework. Under this view, fields may overlap and may be either diminished or universal in scope."

    "\n",
    "It is very important to understand how Lorentz could derive these equations without the concept of absolute time and a computational field, and there is a very good reason for why it happened. In the expanded version of the theory it explains the following concept further (look at source folder), the speed of light is interpreted as operating at a fixed bib-rate. This makes it possible to reach correct conclusions about time dilation even without an explicit computational-field model and  the concept of absolute time, because light is treated as a direct reflection (or manifestation) of the absolute time (this is because absolute time and light are ticking at the same rate). The video below will give you an explanation of the developement of the theory of relativity, including these new additions. \n",
