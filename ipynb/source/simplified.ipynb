    "In repeated observations of vehicles within a defined region, the measured frequency of cars displaying a specific number-plate pattern significantly exceeded the predicted probability derived from the binomial distribution.\n",

    "## **Abstract**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section develops a **Computational Theory of Relativity** to account for a set of persistent, high-magnitude deviations observed in vehicle number-plate frequencies within a defined region. Empirically, outcomes that should be rare under a classical binomial model (e.g., (p=0.01), (n=1000), (E[X]=10), (\\sigma\\approx3.15)) are repeatedly observed at rates on the order of (X>200), and this anomaly persists across many consecutive days—driving the compound improbability to effectively zero under standard stochastic assumptions. A further critical feature is **observer discrepancy**: simultaneous observers in the same locality report incompatible distributions (e.g., (0%) vs (30%)), implying the measured statistics are **observer-dependent** rather than globally objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain these observations, the framework treats each observer and observed system as a **computational process** embedded in a broader **computational reference field**. The theory is explicitly **stateful**: present observations depend not only on immediate conditions but also on informational dependencies extending across frames. Most importantly, the deviation cannot be reduced to **internal dynamics** (drivers, engines, traffic micro-behaviors). If the mechanism were internal, similarly configured physical systems under similar external conditions would converge toward similar distributions. The persistence of incompatible local distributions therefore motivates **non-local informational coupling**, where external information (not intrinsic mechanics alone) modulates realized outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the document connects the empirical deviation to an **entropic/informational bias** formalized via reweighting (e.g., cross-entropy divergence between expected (P) and observed (Q)), interpreting the anomaly as a computationally induced concentration of realized configurations. The subsequent propositions formalize these claims and outline simulation-based verification against binomial expectation.\n",

    "Relative probability is an addition to the theory of relativity which has been discovered from the completion of this work. Distant information tied to human concepts and conventions clearly changed the probability of an event and it must have been done through a computational and informational field or framework. The thought experiments of Einstein and Lorentz may be understood not solely as geometric outcomes dictated by the constancy of the speed of light, but as evidence for the existence of an informational and computational field. For example, whenever there is time dilation present, it indicates that a computational process (as a task) is taking too long to complete. In this way, the unusual phenomena documented in empirical observations are accounted for by the presence of a computational field and re-integrated through the new interpretation of the theory of relativity. Thus, information was applied within the computational field to change a molecule’s state which had an impact on its position and configuration. Performing that computation required energy and subsequently causes time dilation; therefore, information can be treated as a form of energy. This implies the existence of mechanisms for extracting information from molecular configurations that show significant deviations from expected probability distributions. At no point do these findings conflict with established physical sciences; rather, interpreting relativity as a computational field expands the breadth and scope of possible explanations in physics, addressing questions—such as the emergence of life from nothing—that general physics alone cannot adequately resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this work, Lorentz’s experimental results were reinterpreted through a framework aligned with a computational-field philosophy. In this view, there is no truly inertial frame in the conventional sense: only the absolute reference frame qualifies as inertial. With that premise in place, the mathematics is reformulated by introducing an absolute unit of time—bibs. Consequently, if two processes occur simultaneously within the absolute reference frame, they will agree on the same number of bibs that have elapsed relative to the absolute reference frame (as we can see in proposition 1). Accordingly, all reference frames retain a degree of agreement about when an event occurs—analogous to the classical notion of absolute time—except that, here, this shared timing is grounded in an independent underlying framework rather than being built into the classical spacetime model.\n",

    "* ##### **Proposition 2: Statefulness**  \n",
    "  The formation of any reference frame is shaped by both local and non-local factors. Information is stored, and the information stored can be used to conduct a computation. This makes the system inherently stateful, allowing information from the past and the future to influence how each frame is generated. The amount of such information can be arbitrarily large in-terms of distance and time. This may occur when several frames have already been completed in the absolute reference frame while the current frame is still being experienced in our reality—meaning that more than one frame exists ahead of the one we perceive.\n",

They accomplish this through the life-processing factor $p_{l}$ (Proposition 6) and the probability-dilation effect $p_{\\text{obs}} = \\gamma p_{\\text{exp}}$ (Proposition 8). Although originating from local interactions, the resulting influence is effectively non-local.\n",

    "* **Corollary 2:**   \n",
    "  In the number-plate case (vehicles with plates beginning “DA”), the system’s response was not determined solely by the immediate, local observation. It depended on a wider contextual state: the existence and rules of the New South Wales registration scheme, the semantics of the “DA” prefix within that scheme, the spatial and temporal distribution of matching vehicles, and the observer’s own location and reference conditions—conditions that were themselves modified by making the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  More generally, any conceptual information that constrains interpretation (categories, labels, institutional rules, conventions, expectations, and prior context) can function as part of the effective state. The computational frame can therefore treat human-level concepts as usable constraints—mapping them into operational variables that shape which outcomes are selected or emphasized, rather than restricting “inputs” to purely physical measurements.\n",
