This makes the system inherently stateful, allowing information from the past and the future to influence how each frame is generated. The amount of such information can be arbitrarily large in-terms of distance and time. This may occur when several frames have already been completed in the absolute reference frame while the current frame is still being experienced in our reality—meaning that more than one frame exists ahead of the one we perceive.\n",
