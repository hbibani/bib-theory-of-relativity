        "In **information theory**, this means that encoding events from a true process with \\( P=[0.995, 0.005] \\) but assuming \\( Q=[0.7, 0.3] \\) requires an average of **0.52 bits per event**, rather than the optimal **0.045 bits** if \\( Q=P \\).  \n",
        "This inefficiency represents a **divergence between expectation and reality** — a misalignment of informational models.\n",
        "\n",
        "In **physical terms**, however, if the rare outcome’s observed frequency rises from \\(0.005\\) to \\(0.3\\), the system becomes **more concentrated** around that event.  \n",
        "Although Shannon entropy rises (more uncertainty about which event you’ll see), **configurational entropy** decreases because spatial possibilities collapse toward a single dominant configuration.\n",
