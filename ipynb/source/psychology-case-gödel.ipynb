    "# The Curious Case of Kurt Gödel’s Psychiatric Symptoms That Lead To His Subsequent Death Due To Starvation\n",

    "* # **Background**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Who Gödel was (context in one paragraph)\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) was an Austrian-born logician and mathematician, best known for the incompleteness theorems (1931). He spent much of his later career at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, where he was faculty from the 1950s and emeritus from 1976 until his death.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The core “starvation” account (what most sources agree on)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple reputable biographical summaries (e.g., Encyclopaedia Britannica and IAS) describe a late-life pattern of worsening paranoia—specifically a fear of being poisoned—that became entangled with eating. A commonly repeated detail is that Gödel would only eat if his wife, Adele, tasted or prepared the food. When she became seriously ill and was hospitalized for an extended period in late 1977, he largely stopped eating and rapidly deteriorated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dates and the official cause of death (high-confidence specifics)\n",
    "\n",
    "Biographical sources report that Gödel died on January 14, 1978, in Princeton Hospital, and that he was severely underweight at death (often cited as about 65 lb / ~30 kg). Wikipedia (citing a modern Gödel biography) reproduces the wording attributed to the death certificate: “malnutrition and inanition caused by personality disturbance.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "* ##### **Abstract**  \n",
    "\n",
    "This document isolates a peculiar psychiatric pattern that feels almost engineered against the subject: two disturbances that may originate from different mechanisms nevertheless “lock” together because they overlap in time and share the same meaning. The first disturbance is anticipatory paranoia—the idea that poisoning is coming. The second is a contiguous hallucination—a bodily or perceptual certainty of poison or drugs that arises during the act of eating. What makes the case feel uncanny is not merely that both symptoms exist, but that they arrive in a configuration that mimics external confirmation: the hallucination is timed so closely with eating that the mind treats it as evidence about the food, and its content (“poison”) is semantically identical to the paranoia’s theme. In effect, the second symptom does not simply add distress; it behaves like a false witness that testifies in the exact language the first symptom is already prepared to believe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strangeness intensifies when the symptoms are considered in order. If paranoia comes first, the hallucination is interpreted as proof; if hallucination came first (in isolation), it might be dismissed as bodily error. But in the observed sequence, the hallucination lands on a mind already primed with suspicion, and the suspicion is then “validated” by an experience that feels immediate, sensory, and therefore incontestable. The two symptoms thus form a self-sealing loop: belief guides interpretation, interpretation hardens belief, and the person’s rational faculties—however formidable in other domains—are forced to reason inside a corrupted evidentiary environment. In that sense, the tragedy is not that logic failed, but that logic was compelled to operate on inputs whose timing and meaning made them indistinguishable from reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Deon: Then why would he trust his wife and not everybody else? You know, after she died, he stopped trusting everyone. He refused to eat, and then he died of starvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azur: It’s very simple. When his wife handed him the food, he wouldn’t hallucinate. Therefore, the way he would hallucinate—when it did occur—would have an effect on how he interpreted the events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Kali: You think he believed they were forcing his wife into that situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Azur: Look, we don’t need to complicate this any further. It’s a strange situation, and like everything else that is strange, it requires clear and deep thinking. You have to be prudent. So I invite you to read this document.\n",

    "* **Scholium 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the symptoms presented shaped how Gödel interpreted what was happening, sustaining a belief—tied specifically to his wife’s role in the situation—throughout the ordeal for an extended period. In other words, the symptoms manifested in a way that could anchor an entire belief-system for a long duration of time. The concern raised here is that certain psychological states may be manufactured or engineered by something external to the body, in a manner analogous to the DA number-plate probability shifts. We argue there is evidence that some individuals’ bodily states are being modified by what appears to be an intelligent, omnipresent field. If the claim is that shifting a cell’s internal state—or steering the behaviour of large populations (like people in NSW) into unusual patterns—requires a highly sophisticated kind of understanding of the human body, then that same level of understanding could plausibly be used to create the circumstances of Kurt’s case. That is, a computational field was involved in the creation of Kurt's terrible circumstances.\n",

    "* ##### **Proposition 1 - Contiguous**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two events are contiguous if they share a narrow border in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A man eats food and hallucinates that there are amphetamines in the food. There are two events:\n",
    "\n",
    "Event 1: The event of eating the food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Event 2: The event of hallucinating that there is poison in the food.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corollary 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A hallucination can have a hypnotic effect if it is contiguous in time with another event that has occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration 2:** \n",
    "\n",
    " A person who is paranoid about being poisoned may be hypnotised by a hallucination of poisoning if the hallucination is contiguous with the experience of eating. The timing of these events causes the person to believe that the cause lies in the food rather than an issue with his body. In other words, the contiguity of the events makes it difficult for him to recognise the experience as a hallucination.\n",
    "For example, if he experienced the sensation of amphetamines in his body without having eaten that day, he would not associate the hallucination with the food. Therefore, the contiguous occurrence of the two events affects how the man interprets their cause: the timing leads him to believe the hallucination originates from the food rather than from his own body.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### **Proposition 2 - Semantically Related Psychological Symptoms**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Two psychiatric symptoms are semantically or conceptually related when the concepts underlying the two symptoms are similar or identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "A person is paranoid and anticipates that he will be poisoned. After eating food, he hallucinates that there are drugs in the food he has eaten. There are two disturbances stemming from TWO SEPARATE SYSTEMS:\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptom 1: The feeling or anticipation that he will be poisoned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptom 2: The hallucination associated with the contiguous events that occurred while eating food (see Proposition 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both symptoms are conceptually related, as they concern poisoning, even though they are produced by separate systems. If the second symptom were related to something other than poisoning, it would have a different effect on how the person interprets his circumstances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the second symptom is conceptually related to poisoning, it intensifies the first symptom. For example, if a man hallucinated that there was a giraffe in the room, this would not affect his anticipation of being poisoned, because the two concepts (animal/giraffe and poisoning) are unrelated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corollary 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually related psychiatric symptoms can have a hypnotic effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration 2:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The second symptom can cause the first symptom to appear real and justified, thereby influencing the interpretation of circumstances. In this way, the hallucination of poisoning may be used to validate and reinforce the existing paranoia.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### **Proposition 3 - Order**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Order is the sequence in which a symptom presents itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, a man began to develop paranoia that he was being poisoned. In 2023, he began to experience hallucinations of amphetamines in his food (see Proposition 1, Demonstration 1). These two symptoms appeared in a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corollary 1:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The order in which symptoms appear can influence how they are interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration 2:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of circumstances would differ if the second hallucination had occurred first. Without prior paranoia, it would be easier to recognise that there is an issue with the body rather than food tampering. This is because, in the absence of paranoia, the individual’s reasoning is clearer and more capable of identifying the experience as a hallucination.\n",
    "If the order were reversed, the patient may be blindsided and exclude hallucination as a possibility, which could then affect judgement and further validate the paranoia."
