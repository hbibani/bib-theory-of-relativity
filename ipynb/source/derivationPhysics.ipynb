    "Statistical mechanics is powerful precisely because it *throws information away*: it replaces the full microscopic dynamics—vector forces, constraints, couplings, path-dependence, feedback, and control—with an equilibrium or near-equilibrium description in terms of coarse variables (energy levels, multiplicities, temperature, chemical potentials) and a measure on state space. That abstraction is the pitfall in this setting: if the central claim is that a *field* is acting by selectively biasing outcomes (holographness/granularity), then the very thing you care about is exactly what statistical mechanics typically integrates out—namely the *mechanism* that produces the bias, i.e. which degrees of freedom are being driven, what forces/constraints are applied, how the driving is oriented in time, and what resources are consumed to sustain it. In canonical Boltzmann form, you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\propto e^{-E/(k_B T)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you introduce dilation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\text{obs}}=\\gamma p_{\\text{exp}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Folding this into Boltzmann language yields an “effective energy shift”:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta E = -k_B T \\ln\\gamma.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That mapping is mathematically valid, but it is also *mechanistically silent*: it says “a bias exists” because the probabilities changed, yet it does not specify **what actually changed in the world** to make those probabilities change. By contrast, a physical derivation forces the missing information back into the model in the most general way: you must say **what is being pushed**, **what is being constrained**, and **what conserved quantities are being reallocated**. Instead of merely stating “state (i) is more likely,” you specify what changed in terms of forces/impulses (vector actions that redirect motion), energy and momentum bookkeeping (what is removed, injected, or diverted), and admissibility conditions (what ranges of motion remain physically realizable). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, statistical mechanics is excellent for *inferring* a bias from observed frequencies, but it is weak for *identifying* the causal channel of the bias; the physical derivation restores the missing commitments—forces as vectors, impulses as integrals of force over time, and energy/momentum as conserved currencies—so the dilation is no longer just “a factor (\\gamma)” that rescales probabilities, but a concrete statement about what must have happened dynamically to the system to make one set of outcomes more likely than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, statistical mechanics remains extremely useful here because it still tells us *what* is changing inside the system, even if it does not explicitly show *how* it is changing at the level of forces. By comparing expected and observed distributions, we can infer which class of variables the field must be acting upon and, therefore, where the intervention is taking place. In particular, the analysis indicates that as dilation occurs the relevant mechanical content of the molecular ensemble—most directly reflected in kinetic-energy is systematically reduced or re-partitioned. That is a key diagnostic: it means the dilation is not merely a symbolic reweighting of probabilities, but corresponds to a real transformation in the energy distribution over accessible microstates. In other words, as probabilities dilate, the field is effectively reshaping the energetic landscape that governs motion and constraint, which is precisely why statistical mechanics, despite its abstractions, is still able to localize the “site” of the field’s action to those force/energy channels rather than to inert properties such as mass.\n",

    "The diminished computational field reshapes the system’s energy landscape by exerting non-local, force-like influences on other molecules within the system. The field effectively imitates collision-driven energy transfer between molecules, but does so via a non-local, “force-at-a-distance” mechanism. The field transfers energy through non-local forces, and this transfer of kinetic energy lowers the energy of the affected molecules while increasing the energy of other molecules elsewhere (i.e., entropy rises somewhere else).\n",

    "* ##### **Proposition 2 — The Small Energy Scale of the Field’s Direct Action**\n",
    "\n",
    "The field acts primarily on tiny energy systems at the atomic and molecular scale. Consequently, large macroscopic bodies do not experience large probability shifts *directly* from the field. Instead, the field modifies the microscopic landscape (local constraints, force-directions, and energy partitioning), and macroscopic outcomes change only when a macroscopic system is *functionally coupled* to those microscopic degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $k_{e}$ is the limit of energy or informational capacity of that field. It is usually tiny, and therefore, we would not expect large macroscopic changes in the position of large inanimate bodies. Within this framework, $k_{e}$ is best interpreted as the field’s *energy-capacity* (or “budget”) for reshaping the energy landscape it can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corollary 1 — Why macroscopic motion can still shift**\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering Proposition 2, it may seem contradictory that a human being—an obviously large physical body—can still exhibit a significant probability shift in its motion, as seen with the movement with the cars with DA-prefix. Because microscopic perturbations can be amplified into large macroscopic motion changes, the dramatic outcomes should not be read as “high field power”, however that is not the case. Human beings (and other biological agents) behave as structured, “robotic” microscopic systems: their macroscopic motion is mediated by vast numbers of microscopic control events (molecular binding, ionic gradients, neural firing, muscle cross-bridge cycles). Therefore, even a small bias in the microscopic landscape can propagate upward through biological control loops and produce large shifts in the trajectories and positions of much heavier bodies. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corollary 2 — Macroscopic amplification is not a direct measure of field strength**\n",
    "\n",
    "Observed large-scale effects do not imply that the field directly applies large forces to macroscopic masses. Rather, the field can act weakly at the microscopic level while still generating dramatic macroscopic outcomes through amplification (feedback, switching, and threshold effects) inside the organism.\n",
