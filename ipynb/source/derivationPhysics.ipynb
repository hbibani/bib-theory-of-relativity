    "Statistical mechanics is powerful precisely because it *throws information away*: it replaces the full microscopic dynamics—vector forces, constraints, couplings, path-dependence, feedback, and control—with an equilibrium or near-equilibrium description in terms of coarse variables (energy levels, multiplicities, temperature, chemical potentials) and a measure on state space. That abstraction is the pitfall in this setting: if the central claim is that a *field* is acting by selectively biasing outcomes (holographness/granularity), then the very thing you care about is exactly what statistical mechanics typically integrates out—namely the *mechanism* that produces the bias, i.e. which degrees of freedom are being driven, what forces/constraints are applied, how the driving is oriented in time, and what resources are consumed to sustain it. In canonical Boltzmann form, you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\propto e^{-E/(k_B T)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you introduce dilation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\text{obs}}=\\gamma p_{\\text{exp}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Folding this into Boltzmann language yields an “effective energy shift”:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta E = -k_B T \\ln\\gamma.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That mapping is mathematically valid, but it is also *mechanistically silent*: it says “a bias exists” because the probabilities changed, yet it does not specify **what actually changed in the world** to make those probabilities change. By contrast, a physical derivation forces the missing information back into the model in the most general way: you must say **what is being pushed**, **what is being constrained**, and **what conserved quantities are being reallocated**. Instead of merely stating “state (i) is more likely,” you specify what changed in terms of forces/impulses (vector actions that redirect motion), energy and momentum bookkeeping (what is removed, injected, or diverted), and admissibility conditions (what ranges of motion remain physically realizable). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, statistical mechanics is excellent for *inferring* a bias from observed frequencies, but it is weak for *identifying* the causal channel of the bias; the physical derivation restores the missing commitments—forces as vectors, impulses as integrals of force over time, and energy/momentum as conserved currencies—so the dilation is no longer just “a factor (\\gamma)” that rescales probabilities, but a concrete statement about what must have happened dynamically to the system to make one set of outcomes more likely than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, statistical mechanics remains extremely useful here because it still tells us *what* is changing inside the system, even if it does not explicitly show *how* it is changing at the level of forces. By comparing expected and observed distributions, we can infer which class of variables the field must be acting upon and, therefore, where the intervention is taking place. In particular, the analysis indicates that as dilation occurs the relevant mechanical content of the molecular ensemble—most directly reflected in kinetic-energy is systematically reduced or re-partitioned. That is a key diagnostic: it means the dilation is not merely a symbolic reweighting of probabilities, but corresponds to a real transformation in the energy distribution over accessible microstates. In other words, as probabilities dilate, the field is effectively reshaping the energetic landscape that governs motion and constraint, which is precisely why statistical mechanics, despite its abstractions, is still able to localize the “site” of the field’s action to those force/energy channels rather than to inert properties such as mass.\n",
