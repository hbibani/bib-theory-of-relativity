    "Statistical mechanics is powerful precisely because it *throws information away*: it replaces the full microscopic dynamics—vector forces, constraints, couplings, path-dependence, feedback, and control—with an equilibrium or near-equilibrium description in terms of coarse variables (energy levels, multiplicities, temperature, chemical potentials) and a measure on state space. That abstraction is the pitfall in this setting: if the central claim is that a *field* is acting by selectively biasing outcomes (holographness/granularity), then the very thing you care about is exactly what statistical mechanics typically integrates out—namely the *mechanism* that produces the bias, i.e. which degrees of freedom are being driven, what forces/constraints are applied, how the driving is oriented in time, and what resources are consumed to sustain it. In canonical Boltzmann form, you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\propto e^{-E/(k_B T)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you introduce dilation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{\\text{obs}}=\\gamma p_{\\text{exp}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Folding this into Boltzmann language yields an “effective energy shift”:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta E = -k_B T \\ln\\gamma.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That mapping is mathematically valid, but it is also *mechanistically silent*: it says “a bias exists” because the probabilities changed, yet it does not specify **what actually changed in the world** to make those probabilities change. By contrast, a physical derivation forces the missing information back into the model in the most general way: you must say **what is being pushed**, **what is being constrained**, and **what conserved quantities are being reallocated**. Instead of merely stating “state (i) is more likely,” you specify what changed in terms of forces/impulses (vector actions that redirect motion), energy and momentum bookkeeping (what is removed, injected, or diverted).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, statistical mechanics is excellent for *inferring* a bias from observed frequencies, but it is weak for *identifying* the causal channel of the bias; the physical derivation restores the missing commitments—forces as vectors, impulses as integrals of force over time, and energy/momentum as conserved currencies—so the dilation is no longer just “a factor (\\gamma)” that rescales probabilities, but a concrete statement about what must have happened dynamically to the system to make one set of outcomes more likely than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, statistical mechanics remains extremely useful here because it still tells us *what* is changing inside the system, even if it does not explicitly show *how* it is changing at the level of forces. By comparing expected and observed distributions, we can infer which class of variables the field must be acting upon and, therefore, where the intervention is taking place. In particular, the analysis indicates that as dilation occurs the relevant mechanical content of the molecular ensemble—most directly reflected in kinetic-energy is systematically reduced or re-partitioned. That is a key diagnostic: it means the dilation is not merely a symbolic reweighting of probabilities, but corresponds to a real transformation in the energy distribution over accessible microstates. In other words, as probabilities dilate, the field is effectively reshaping the energetic landscape that governs motion and constraint, which is precisely why statistical mechanics, despite its abstractions, is still able to localize the “site” of the field’s action to those force/energy interactions rather than to inert properties such as mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical model helped us derive two main things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The field’s role is defined by what parts of the system it acts on and how it changes the energy landscape. In this framework, kinetic energy can only be allocated and reallocated via Newtonian dynamics: motion changes only when forces act, and forces enter as external interactions. The field therefore influences the system by introducing effective external forces that modify particle trajectories, after which energy is redistributed—potentially through highly targeted, “collision-at-a-distance” interactions that replicate the same redistribution you would normally attribute to direct collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The processing factor $\\frac{m v^2}{2k_e}$ that is used to derive the dilation formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard treatments of relativity, we describe *that* additional energy is required to further accelerate a body, but we do not give a systematic account of *why* this extra energetic cost appears in mechanistic terms; Most intuition is anchored to the dilation effect itself: derivations and estimates are largely built around how dilation modifies quantities like momentum, rather than explaining why the additional energetic cost must exist in the first place. For example, Einstein reasoned from the fact of dilation (not it's causes) and worked out how it must modify momentum and related quantities, rather than beginning from a mechanistic account of why an additional energy cost must arise in the first place. Historically, this framing followed from the constancy of the speed of light, which produced the dilation relations directly but left the underlying reason for the required “extra cost” comparatively under-explained. In the interpretation developed here, that “extra energy” is attributed to computational duties imposed by all types of fields: In the case of the effects of motion for example, as velocity increases, a growing fraction of the system’s available energy must be diverted into transformative effects of the field itself. This diversion manifests as additional inertia and, consequently, as the increased energy required to push a vehicle to higher speeds. Below, the following propositions explain how a diminished field reshapes the energy landscape by redistributing energy, and characterize the energetic cost required for the field to perform these duties as computational demands. \n",

    "* ##### **Proposition 1: The Computational Field**\n",
    "\n",
    "The diminished computational field reshapes the system’s energy landscape by exerting non-local, force-like influences on other molecules within the system. The field effectively imitates collision-driven energy transfer between molecules, but does so via a non-local, “force-at-a-distance” mechanism. The field transfers and redistributes energy through non-local forces, and this transfer of kinetic energy lowers the energy of the affected molecules while increasing the energy of other molecules elsewhere (i.e., entropy rises somewhere else).\n",

    "* **Corollary 1:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "A fraction of the molecule’s kinetic energy is diverted to satisfy the computational demand required to generate the field’s effects. The processing factor $\\frac{m v^2}{2k_e}$ is that proportion, as shown in the derivation of $\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{m v^2}{2k_e}}} $ at the bottom of the document. The same method is also used to derive $\\gamma_v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$, which is likewise included at the bottom.\n",

It can, however, be recovered from base principles through independent derivations, which supports the original intuition and shows it is consistent with the underlying $K'=K-e$ energy distribution pattern which was the design of the above formula. The derivation was only recognized after establishing the (K' = K - e) relation, and the blind derivation played no role in forming the base formula. (VERY IMPORTANT) The intuition (K' = K - e) was guided by the philosophy of the computational framework, which allowed extremely accurate predictions of the results without relying on blind derivation, indicating that the computational framework philosophy is more accurate than existing frameworks. \n",

    "The key quantity we actually had in hand was the processing factor $\\frac{mv^2}{2k_e}$, not the full internal structure of the dilation term itself.

Instead, the field modifies the microscopic landscape (local constraints, force-directions, and energy partitioning).\n",

    "The term $k_{e}$ is the limit of energy or informational capacity of that field. It is usually tiny, and therefore, we would not expect large macroscopic changes in the position of large inanimate bodies. Within this framework, $k_{e}$ is best interpreted as the field’s *energy-capacity* (or “budget”) for reshaping the energy landscape it can handle.\n",

    "\n",
    "Considering Proposition 2, it may seem contradictory that a human being—an obviously large physical body—can still exhibit a significant probability shift in its motion, as seen with the movement with the cars with DA-prefix. Because microscopic perturbations can be amplified into large macroscopic motion changes, the dramatic outcomes should not be read as “high field power”. Human beings (and other biological agents) behave as structured, “robotic” microscopic systems: their macroscopic motion is mediated by vast numbers of microscopic control events (molecular binding, ionic gradients, neural firing, muscle cross-bridge cycles). Therefore, even a small bias in the microscopic landscape can propagate upward through biological control loops and produce large shifts in the trajectories and positions of much heavier bodies (which are animate). \n",
