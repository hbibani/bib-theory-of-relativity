    "### 🧠 Information Guides Evolution Through the Senses\n",
    "\n",
    "We propose that information received through sensory input can guide biological change during an organism’s lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔬 Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Information from sensory organs—such as antennae in the ichneumon wasp—provides guidance to the body about how to adapt or change based on environmental context, such as the relationship between ants and butterflies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📐 Proposition 1\n",
    "\n",
    "It is impossible that the ichneumon wasp evolved before ants and butterflies due to its biological dependency on both.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 Corollary 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The wasp's reproductive organs rely on butterfly larvae, meaning butterflies must have evolved earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔎 Corollary 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Butterfly larvae mimic ant scent, suggesting ants predate butterflies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct evolutionary sequence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Ant} \\rightarrow \\text{Butterfly} \\rightarrow \\text{Ichneumon wasp}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### ⚡ Rapid Structural Shift as a Mechanism for Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider short-term, postnatal organ transformations as potential contributors to long-term evolutionary change.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔬 Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "While standard evolutionary theory focuses on gradual inherited changes, certain physical changes—like those at puberty—may represent rapid shifts that occur cyclically across long timescales (e.g., every 20,000 years).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "Organs can develop after birth (e.g., puberty). The Guedoves phenomenon exemplifies this but does not meet evolutionary criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📐 Evolutionary Classification Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "A postnatal structural change qualifies as evolutionary only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Novelty Condition**: The organ has not been previously present in the species.\n",
    "- **Utility Condition**: The organ provides a selective advantage in the given environment.\n",

    "  The chance of a particle following a specific path through approximately 40,000 random steps is near zero.\n",

    "  In 2D and 3D systems, the computational complexity of generating exact configurations grows exponentially.\n",

    "- **Proposition 5**:  \n",
    "  Life requires lower entropy than its surrounding environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Corollary 1**:  \n",
    "  The presence of low-entropy order implies external or internal structuring forces at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧲 Necessity of an External Force\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proposition 6**:  \n",
    "  If random processes in closed systems cannot explain low-entropy structures, a new causal factor is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Proposition 7**:  \n",
    "  The most plausible cause is an interface between the system and an external agent.\n",
