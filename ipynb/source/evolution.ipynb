    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alcon blue butterfly (Phengaris alcon) forms a highly specific, structured interaction with Myrmica ants: after early feeding on gentian, its larva switches strategy and chemically mimics ant brood so precisely that workers carry it into the nest and feed it via trophallaxis. This ant–butterfly ordering then becomes the target of a second, more specialized ordering: the ichneumon wasp (e.g., Ichneumon eumerus) uses chemosensory guidance (antennae-mediated detection) to locate nests that contain these larvae, enters the colony, disrupts ant coordination with chemical interference that provokes worker–worker aggression, and then oviposits into the butterfly larva or pupa. The wasp is therefore a parasitoid operating inside the ant–butterfly system, i.e., a parasite of a parasite, and the full chain of interactions is itself a concrete example of decision-relevant sensory information being used to navigate and exploit a structured ecological context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information received through sensory organs—such as the antennae of the ichneumon wasp—guides how an organism adapts or responds to its environmental context, including structured interspecies interactions such as those between ants and butterflies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolutionary ordering (in which they appear in time) of this triad—Alcon blue mimicry, ant adoption/maintenance, then ichneumon infiltration—arises from a specific mechanism: sensory inputs are transmitted through biological interfaces and processed by internal informational systems that govern decision-making and behavior. The observed evolutionary ordering of these insects emerged through this mechanism, and the mechanism itself is the direct cause of the order. Consequently, the sequence in which these insects emerged serves as evidence for the existence of the mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information-processing systems that regulate and act on information are therefore responsible for the observed order. Within existing theoretical frameworks, no explicit informational systems are defined as drivers of evolutionary processes, nor is there a recognized mechanism by which sensory inputs—such as those received through antennae—are treated as information used to support decision-making within such systems. It would be highly unlikely that an entirely robotic system, exposed to a hostile environment such as ours, could consistently make correct decisions about organ design and remain viable beyond a short timespan, if it didn't use this type of information to form decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "THE MECHANISM DESCRIBED ABOVE PRODUCED THIS ORDER IN HOW THE INSECTS DEVELOPED THEIR ORGANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### **Proposition 1 - Evolutionary Dependency Constraint**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ichneumon wasp could not have evolved before the ant–butterfly system, because its reproductive strategy depends on a pre-existing interaction in which butterfly larvae are adopted and maintained inside ant nests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corollary 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The wasp’s reproduction requires access to butterfly larvae or pupae within the ant nest environment; therefore the butterfly lineage (with the relevant larval stage) must predate the wasp.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corollary 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Alcon blue larva’s survival strategy depends on mimicking Myrmica ant brood cues (chemical/behavioral signals) so that ants retrieve it and rear it in the nest; therefore the ant lineage and its brood-recognition system must predate the butterfly’s ant-mimicry adaptation.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Ant} \\rightarrow \\text{Butterfly} \\rightarrow \\text{Ichneumon wasp}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ordering can be used to evaluate fossil dating methods and models of inter-species co-evolution. The ichneumon wasp acquires information about the interaction between the Alcon blue butterfly and ants through sensory input from its antennae. This information is processed by the wasp’s internal informational systems, which interpret the relationship between the chemical signatures of the ant and the butterfly. Through this mechanism, the wasp’s informational system rapidly facilitated the development of the organs required to intervene within that existing biological relationship. It is not plausible that sensory information acquired through the antennae played no role in driving the organ-level response observed. This information-processing system—and the way it interfaces with environmental inputs—is the main driver of the evolutionary order of appearance of these three insects (over time) that we observe.\n",

    "While standard evolutionary theory emphasizes gradual inherited changes, certain physical changes may occur as rapid, discrete shifts that recur across long timescales.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ##### **Observation 1 — Postnatal Organ Development**\n",
    "\n",
    "Organs and sex-specific anatomy can develop or change after birth, as seen in the güevedoce phenomenon, where some individuals who appear female in early childhood develop male-typical characteristics around puberty. This shows that significant anatomical change can occur postnatally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such changes support the possibility that evolution may proceed through structured developmental mechanisms producing discrete shifts, rather than solely through gradual random variation. This implies that a biological system may undergo rapid, organized structural changes at intervals of approximately 20,000 years, followed by extended periods of relative stability during other stages of development. In this way, the organism’s body is periodically reorganized through discrete, coordinated transformations rather than continuous slow change. These types of changes are rapid and intended (not gradual), which is distinct from current theories that imply slow and gradual change. Such slow and gradual change is not viable in an environment of this level of hostility, it is significantly more plausible that this theory is more accurate.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "A postnatal structural change qualifies as evolutionary only if both conditions are met:\n",

As an analogy, one may be able to speak to a ghost and be heard, yet the ghost can walk through the person without physical resistance. The interaction is real but incomplete: certain channels of interaction are available (information exchange), while others are absent (mechanical or material coupling). The ghost is present within the same space, but the coupling between entities is selective rather than total. In such cases, the field acts selectively rather than universally.\n",
