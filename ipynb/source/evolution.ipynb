    "## Information-Guided Evolution Through Sensory Mechanisms\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Hypothesis 1 — Information-Guided Biological Change\n",
    "\n",
    "Information received through sensory organs—such as the antennae of the ichneumon wasp—guides how an organism adapts or responds to its environmental context, including structured interspecies interactions such as those between ants and butterflies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order arises through a specific mechanism: sensory inputs are transmitted through biological interfaces and processed by internal informational systems that govern decision-making and behavior. The observed evolutionary ordering of these insects emerged through this mechanism, and the mechanism itself is the direct cause of the order. Consequently, the sequence in which these insects emerged serves as evidence for the existence of the mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information-processing systems that regulate and act on information are therefore responsible for the observed order. Within existing theoretical frameworks, no explicit informational systems are defined as drivers of evolutionary processes, nor is there a recognized mechanism by which sensory inputs—such as those received through antennae—are treated as information used to support decision-making within such systems. It would be highly unlikely that an entirely robotic system, exposed to a hostile environment such as ours, could consistently make correct decisions about organ design and remain viable beyond a short timespan, if it didn't use this type of information to form decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the ichneumon wasp acquires information about the interaction between the Alcon blue butterfly and ants through sensory input from its antennae. This information is processed by the wasp’s internal informational systems, which interpret the relationship between the chemical signatures of the ant and the butterfly. Through this mechanism, the wasp’s informational system rapidly facilitated the development of the organs required to intervene within that existing biological relationship. It is not plausible that sensory information acquired through the antennae played no role in driving the organ-level response observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 1 — Evolutionary Dependency Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "It is impossible for the ichneumon wasp to have evolved before ants and butterflies due to its biological dependency on both.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Corollary 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The wasp’s reproductive organs rely on butterfly larvae, implying that butterflies must have evolved prior to the wasp.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Corollary 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Butterfly larvae mimic ant scent, implying that ants predate butterflies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion 1\n",
    "\n",
    "The only consistent evolutionary sequence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Ant} \\rightarrow \\text{Butterfly} \\rightarrow \\text{Ichneumon wasp}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ordering can be used to evaluate fossil dating methods and models of inter-species co-evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rapid Structural Shifts as Evolutionary Mechanisms\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Hypothesis 2 — Discrete Evolutionary Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "While standard evolutionary theory emphasizes gradual inherited changes, certain physical changes may occur as rapid, discrete shifts that recur across long timescales.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Observation 1 — Postnatal Organ Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Organs can develop after birth, as observed during puberty. Certain individuals are born with female-appearing genitalia and later develop male genital characteristics during puberty. This demonstrates that significant anatomical change can occur postnatally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such changes support the possibility that evolution may proceed through structured developmental mechanisms producing discrete shifts, rather than solely through gradual random variation. This implies that a biological system may undergo rapid, organized structural changes at intervals of approximately 20,000 years, followed by extended periods of relative stability during other stages of development. In this way, the organism’s body is periodically reorganized through discrete, coordinated transformations rather than continuous slow change. These types of changes are rapid and intended (not gradual), which is distinct from current theories that imply slow and gradual change. Such slow and gradual change is not viable in an environment of this level of hostility, it is significantly more plausible that this theory is more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 2 — Evolutionary Classification Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "A postnatal structural change qualifies as evolutionary only if both conditions are met:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Novelty Condition**: The organ or structure was not previously present in the species.\n",
    "2. **Utility Condition**: The structure provides a selective advantage within its environment.\n",

    "## Mathematical Foundations for the Emergence of Life via Entropy\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Proposition 3 — Path Improbability\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of a particle following a specific path through approximately 40,000 random steps is effectively zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 4 — Configuration Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "In two- and three-dimensional systems, the computational complexity required to generate exact configurations grows exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 5 — Low-Entropy Requirement for Life\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological life requires a low-entropy configuration that is statistically implausible to arise through random processes alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 6 — Entropy Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Entropy ( S ) measures the degree of randomness or disorder in a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 7 — Entropy Contrast\n",
    "\n",
    "Living systems require lower entropy than their surrounding environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Corollary 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of persistent low-entropy order implies the action of structuring forces beyond random dynamics.\n",

    "## Causal Necessity and the Origin of Order\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Proposition 8 — Causal Insufficiency of Random Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "If random processes within closed systems are insufficient to account for persistent low-entropy structures, then an additional causal factor is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 9 — Structuring Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The required causal factor must operate through an interface between the system and an external source of information or constraint, actively biasing the system toward ordered configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 10 — Required Properties of the Causal Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The causal factor must be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Intelligent} &:\\ \\text{capable of directed constraint or structured bias} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Finite} &:\\ \\text{limited in spatial extent, duration, or strength} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Sporadic} &:\\ \\text{active selectively rather than continuously in space-time}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These properties follow logically from entropy constraints and do not rely on metaphysical assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computational Fields as Physical Realization\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties identified in Proposition 10 are necessary for biological organisms to arise sporadically and spontaneously. The corresponding extension to the theory of relativity, provided in the source folder of this GitHub repository, permits the existence of fields that possess these properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\text{Intelligent} &:\\ \\text{capable of directed constraint or structured bias} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Finite} &:\\ \\text{limited in spatial extent, duration, or strength} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Sporadic} &:\\ \\text{active selectively rather than continuously in space-time}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the computational relativity framework, these properties constitute the necessary conditions for the emergence of life. Information functions as the means by which order is produced (directed constraint), holographness allows for limited duration, extent and strength, while the diminished nature of the computational field naturally gives rise to  sporadic activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 11 — Computational Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "All physical fields may be understood as computational fields, including classical fields and informational fields, as evidenced by probabilistic anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational fields fall into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Universal Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Persistent, invariant fields whose effects are reproducible across time and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diminished (Sporadic) Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields that are finite in strength, duration, or scope; may activate selectively; and process information in distinct ways. Variations in processing structure produce variations in outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The properties identified in Proposition 10 are physically realized as diminished computational fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corollary 3 — Origin of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "Diminished fields explain why life does not arise uniformly across space and time, accounting for its localized and episodic emergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corollary 4 — Biological Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "Distinct diminished fields process information independently. Differences in their informational processing modify probability structures, producing biological variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Holographness and Selective Coupling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 12 — Holographness\n",
    "\n",
    "Holographness is the property by which a field couples selectively to certain properties or objects rather than uniformly to all. Interaction may occur through some channels while remaining absent through others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration 1 — DA-Prefix Number Plate Case\n",
    "\n",
    "An informational field affects only a subset of objects, introducing selectivity and non-uniform system-wide influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration 2 — Invariability of Light\n",
    "\n",
    "When a train moves, its material components acquire the train’s velocity, whereas light does not. This demonstrates selective coupling and holographic interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corollary 5 — Unified Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Holographness enables overlapping universal and diminished fields to coexist within a unified computational framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 13 — Granularity\n",
    "\n",
    "A field’s influence is highly granular. In diminished fields, even a single molecular property within a large ensemble may be affected while others remain unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Entropy and probability constraints necessitate a finite, sporadic, and directed causal factor.\n",
    "2. Computational fields—particularly diminished fields—provide the physical mechanism through which such causal properties operate.\n",
    "3. Relativity is extended to include selective, holographic, and granular field interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corollary 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Life does not spontaneously emerge in all environments because the relevant structuring fields are not universally active.\n",
