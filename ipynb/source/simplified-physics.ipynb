    "## ALL OF THE CONCEPTS STARTED FROM INVESTIGATING THE FOLLOWING PHENOMENA (REFER TO SECTION \"Vehicle reference frame positions\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "In repeated observations of vehicles within a defined region, the measured frequency of cars displaying a specific number-plate pattern, with the pre-fix \"DA\" within the NEW SOUTH WALES registration scheme significantly exceeded the predicted probability derived from the binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Abstract**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section develops a **Computational Theory of Relativity** to account for a set of persistent, high-magnitude deviations observed in vehicle number-plate frequencies starting with the prefix-DA within the NSW registration scheme and also a defined region. Empirically, outcomes that should be rare under a classical binomial model (e.g., (p=0.01), (n=1000), (E[X]=10), (\\sigma\\approx3.15)) are repeatedly observed at rates on the order of (X>200), and this anomaly persists across many consecutive days—driving the compound improbability to effectively zero under standard assumptions. A further critical feature is **observer discrepancy**: simultaneous observers in the same locality report incompatible distributions (e.g., (0%) vs (30%)), implying the measured statistics are **observer-dependent** rather than globally objective (relative probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "To explain these observations, the framework treats each observer and observed system as a **computational process** embedded in a broader **computational reference field**. The theory is explicitly **stateful**: information must be stored and present observations depend not only on immediate conditions but also on complex information that include rules which are understandable to human comprehension. For example, the pre-fix \"DA\" within a set of known number-plates in a given region is effectively used to perform a computation, information such as the concept of \"NEW SOUTH WALES REGISTRATION SCHEME\" can be used as inputs to effect the configuration of a molecule. The computational field is also aware of the identities who hold those number plates, and can use this information to perform calculations to alter its positions. Most importantly, the deviation cannot be reduced to **internal dynamics** that are local physical interactions (mass, time, forces, energy and conversions, drivers, engines, traffic micro-behaviors). If the mechanism were internal physical interactions, generalized by different local forces that act on each body, similarly configured physical systems under similar external conditions would converge toward similar probability distributions, but the distributions of probability are too greatly deviated in this investigation. The persistence of incompatible local distributions indicate that external information (not intrinsic mechanics alone) is used to conduct operations in the form of computational calculations that have an impact of the configuration and state of a molecule; which accounts for the deviation, and relates information such as the DA-prefix. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is beyond dispute that this evidence demonstrates the action of a non-local field which is producing modifications to the internal attributes of the human body that ultimately manifest as the observed shift in probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the document connects the empirical deviation to an **entropic/informational bias** formalized through reweighting (e.g., a cross-entropy divergence between the expected distribution (P) and the observed distribution (Q)), interpreting the anomaly as a computationally induced effect on the system’s state. In this view, the state space—defined over positions and configurations—has been deformed in a curved manner analogous to curvature in gravitational space-time fields. The subsequent propositions formalize these claims and outline simulation-based verification against binomial expectations.\n",

    "* ##### **Abstract:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "  Relative probability is an addition to the theory of relativity which has been discovered from the completion of this work. Distant information tied to human concepts and conventions clearly changed the probability of an event and it must have been done through a computational and informational field or framework. The thought experiments of Einstein and Lorentz may be understood not solely as geometric outcomes dictated by the constancy of the speed of light, but as evidence for the existence of an informational and computational field. For example, whenever there is time dilation present, it indicates that a computational process (as a task) is taking too long to complete. In this way, the unusual phenomena documented in empirical observations are accounted for by the presence of a computational field and re-integrated through the new interpretation of the theory of relativity. Thus, information was applied within the computational field to change a molecule’s state which had an impact on its position and configuration. Performing that computation required energy and subsequently causes time dilation; therefore, information can be treated as a form of energy. This implies the existence of mechanisms for extracting information from molecular configurations that show significant deviations from expected probability distributions. At no point do these findings conflict with established physical sciences; rather, interpreting relativity as a computational field expands the breadth and scope of possible explanations in physics, addressing questions—such as the emergence of life from nothing—that general physics alone cannot adequately resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this work, Lorentz’s experimental results were reinterpreted through a framework aligned with a computational-field philosophy. In this view, there is no truly inertial frame in the conventional sense: only the absolute reference frame qualifies as inertial. With that premise in place, the mathematics is reformulated by introducing an absolute unit of time—bibs. Consequently, if two processes occur simultaneously within the absolute reference frame, they will agree on the same number of bibs that have elapsed relative to the absolute reference frame (as we can see in proposition 1). Accordingly, all reference frames retain a degree of agreement about when an event occurs—analogous to the classical notion of absolute time—except that, here, this shared timing is grounded in an independent underlying framework rather than being built into the classical spacetime model.\n"

    "  They reinterpret Lorentz’s results using a computational-field view in which only an **absolute reference frame** is truly inertial. Time is expressed in an absolute unit, **bibs**, so all observers must agree on how much absolute time (how many bibs) has elapsed relative to that frame (ignoring bib-dilation). By analogy with a computer’s shared clock, simultaneous processes in the absolute frame correspond to the same bib count for all observers; this universal agreement is taken as evidence for an underlying computational absolute frame and a revision of the usual inertial-frame notion, while still preserving a limited, classical-like agreement about event timing grounded in the computational framework rather than spacetime itself.\n",
