        "In repeated observations of vehicles within a defined region, the measured frequency of cars displaying a specific number-plate pattern significantly exceeded the predicted probability derived from the binomial distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Proposition 2 (Statistical Expectation)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let the probability \\( p \\) of observing a vehicle with a particular number-plate pattern be \\( p = 0.01 \\),  \n",
        "and let \\( n = 1000 \\) represent the number of observed vehicles.  \n",

        "The actual count of vehicles matching the pattern exceeded \\( 200 \\) within \\( n = 1000 \\) observations,  \n",
        "representing a deviation of more than \\( 60 \\) standard deviations from the expected mean.  \n",
        "Such an occurrence lies beyond any reasonable statistical likelihood in the classical or relativistic physical sense.\n",

        "Two observers in the same spatial region and temporal window recorded incompatible statistical distributions —  \n",
        "one reporting \\( 0\\% \\) occurrence, the other \\( 30\\% \\).  \n",

        "The coordinated deviation of physical systems (e.g., vehicle movement or frequency) cannot be accounted for by purely internal dynamics of the system (engines, drivers, etc.).  \n",
        "If the cause were internal, identical systems under similar external conditions should produce similar distributions.  \n",
        "Hence, the cause must involve **non-local computational coupling** between the absolute reference frame and local physical manifestations.\n",

        "### **Corollary 1 (Information Coupling)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The coupling arises when internal biological or mechanical systems respond not to intrinsic variables but to **external information** —  \n",
